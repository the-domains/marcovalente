            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cultivate the people too: the system is not a machine</h1><p>Maybe you and I are in the same business, of large-scale transformational change. Maybe you also want to make our society better, and the environment on which we depend more resilient.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Scientific and philosophical thoughts behind creating the futures we want</h1><p>For the philosophically curios. Beware, it's a long post.
